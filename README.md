# FILE_RENAMER
A program written by me that renames your files into "Server safe"-files by making everything lowercase, removing special characters and replacing spaces with a underscore.

### Installing

If you want to use the FILE_RENAMER on your system you can grab yourself one of the folders in `/releases/`.

As of now there are releases for MACOS x64 (darwin and mas), Linux x64 and Linux ARMv7 x64, Windows 32x & 64x.
